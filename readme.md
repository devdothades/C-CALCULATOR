# Arithmetic Operations Program

## Project Description

This C program provides a simple command-line interface for performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two integers and select the desired arithmetic operation to obtain the result. The program features robust input validation to ensure that only valid integers are accepted, preventing crashes due to invalid input. Additionally, users have the option to repeat the calculations or exit the program, making it a user-friendly tool for basic math operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures valid integer input for numbers and operation choices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear prompts and options for the user.
- **Repeat Option:** Allows users to continue using the program or exit after each calculation.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of running C programs

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using the command:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c
   
   ./a.out

## Usage
1. Input two integers when prompted.
2. Choose an arithmetic operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
3. View the result of the operation.
4. Decide whether to perform another calculation or exit the program.
